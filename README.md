# 42-CURSUS: *common core projects*

In this repository I am going to share all my projects carried out in the [42 Fundaci√≥n Telef√≥nica](https://www.fundaciontelefonica.com/empleabilidad/campus-42/) cursus.
These proyects are developed in C language.

You can find more details of each project in the corresponding folders. All of them are designed to challenge and expand my knowledge in programming, algorithms and problem-solving. I will update this repository as I progress on my learning path.


I hope it helps you and I will be happy to answer any question if you need it, in that case I leave you my contact information.
